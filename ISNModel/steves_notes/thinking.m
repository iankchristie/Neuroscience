% What to plot
%
%  Should we plot W_E1E2 == W_E2E1 == 0 ?
%   This would answer the question of what happens when only cross
%   suppression is possible
%
%  
%
%  Should we plot W_E1I2 == W_E2I1 == 0? 
%   This would show when cross suppression is impossible; might show
%   interesting results with respect to unidirectional training
