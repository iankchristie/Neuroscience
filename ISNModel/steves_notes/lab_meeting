Single unit -- 

	works, easy

	simulate unselective (strong self coupling), selective (weaker self coupling with feed-forward bias)


Coupled Pair model --

	only works (really) if not coupled, or if inhibitory interactions unlike those observed in cortex

	Can be learned, some good evidence for uncoupling in real circuits

	Unidirectional doesn't work -- trained direction learns, untrained direction does not learn or convert



ISN model --

	It can do bidirectional, unidirectional, half-unidirectional

	the parameter regime for bidirectional and unidirectional is very limited and also requires cross excitation

	the parameter regime for half uni 2 is better, might be more realistic
