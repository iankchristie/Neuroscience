First case to examine:  W_E1E2 == WE2E1 == 0 (we exclude cross excitatory connections)

This condition supports several modes:
	1) unresponsive if input isn't strong enough
	2) other conditions (example: )
	3) Half unidirectionally selective if only 1 of the cross inhibitory connections is strong
	4) Unselective (if WE1I2 and WE2I1 are very small)
	5) Full directional selectivity 

One aspect that isn't fully shown here is that ISN vs. non-ISN is not clear

OK, need to modify; how to do it? how about intensity of color?  will try it

Did this, works

Now looking at W_E1E2 = 0.2, W_E2E1 = 0

there are errors, models goes into multiple categories (HalfUni2 and Directional), will need to investigate
