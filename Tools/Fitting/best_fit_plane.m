function [s,p] = best_fit_plane(x,y,z)

% x,y,z are n x 1 column vectors of the three coordinates
% of a set of n points in three dimensions. s returns with
% the minimum mean square orthogonal distance to a least
% squares best-fit plane. The four coefficients of that
% plane's equation, Ax + By + Cz + D = 0, are returned in
% row vector p = [A,B,C,D]. A,B,C are normalized: A^2+B^2+C^2=1.
